Why IslandsLib ?
================


    «  We don’t manage saltwater intrusion, we’re victims of it » 
    
*Honorable Ralph Regenvanu, Minister of Environment, Vanuatu*, UNOC 2025


    « When you live on such an island, you know that the relationship between freshwater and ocean is not a theory. »

*Samira Ben Ali, Youth Parliament for Water, talking about Mayotte*, UNOC 2025



There are tens of thousands of islands where freshwater is already an issue to its inhabitants.
As the sea level rises the problem will become even more stringent. 
Having knowledge of the volumes and fluxes of water is essential in order to imagine a sustainable future 
for these communities.
Alone no researcher can. As a community maybe. 
IslandsLib is there to help volunteers participate to this effort without advanced  knowledge in modeling techniques.
