IslandsLib: 2D Modeling of Small Islands Freshwater Lenses
==========================================================


IslandsLib is a library that provides  a set of functions and classes to help 

* solve the Poisson equation to model simple freshwater lenses  islands using the pyfreefem library and FreeFem++ software; 
* process IGN (French National Geography Institute) products, for example to create single coastline contours from shapefile for the purpose of modeling.

IslandsLib also provides a data repository of Island contours. **Contributions welcome** !
