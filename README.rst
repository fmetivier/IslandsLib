IslandsLib: 2D modeling of small island water tables
====================================================


IslandsLib is a library that provides  a set of functions and classes to help 

* solve the poisson equation to model simple freshwater lenses  islands using the pyfreefem library and FreeFem++ software; 
* use IGN (French National Geography Institute) products to creat single coastline contours from shapefile for the purpose of modeling.

IslandsLib also provides a data repository of Island contours. Please feel free to contribute !
